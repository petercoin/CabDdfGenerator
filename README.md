# CabDdfGenerator
Tool to easily create directive file for Windows makecab command.  
This tool keeps the folder structure you have in the target folder.

# Usage
Just enter "python main.py [cab_folder] > output.ddf" in command prompt.  
I use print() to print-out all the information to console so you need to use '>' to output the information to a file.
